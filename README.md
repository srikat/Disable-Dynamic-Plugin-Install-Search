# Disable Dynamic Plugin Install Search #

Disable dynamic search on Plugins > Add New in WordPress admin.

## Description ##

This plugin disables search as you type when searching for a plugin on Plugins > Add New screen. This means you can now press down arrow on your keyboard and select your previously typed plugin search term without getting frustrated with built-in Ajax behavior. Hitting return will search the WordPress plugin repository and display the results.

## Installation ##

1. Click on the `Download ZIP` button at the right to download the plugin
2. Upload the entire `disable-plugin-install-live` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
3. Activate the plugin through the `Plugins` menu in WordPress

## Credits ##

Thanks to David Baker (@dtbaker in WPAustralia Slack) for the Javascript code.
